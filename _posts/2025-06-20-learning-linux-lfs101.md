Recently, I completed the best Linux course I've ever taken: **Introduction to Linux (LFS101)** by **The Linux Foundation**.I have been using Linux distributions since 2015, when I was just thirteen years old, so I’m pretty confident in my knowledge of this OS. However, I have learned a lot from this course, and I wouldn't say it's just an introductory course.

## About the course
It's online and self-paced. There's 60 hours of course material, **hands-on labs** and assigments. You can also find a discussion forum, but since I haven't used it, I can't say much about it. According to the [course's page](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/){:target="_blank"}:

>>
This course explores the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux system administrators and end users to achieve their day-to-day work in a Linux environment. You will gain a good working knowledge of Linux and learn how to navigate through major Linux distributions, system configurations and graphical interface of Linux, basic command line operations, common applications of Linux, and more.

Althought it was designed for users with non or little experience with Linux, I personally think experienced users can also benefit from it.

## Exceptional quality

When I started going through the course material, I was surprised at how easy it was to follow and understand, even with complex technical terms. The way it was written made it easy to enjoy as well. To be honest, I didn't expected such quality from a free course. I enjoyed it so much that every time I opened the course page to continue, I felt very motivated. The hands-on labs and exercises are very helpful to reinforce the content presented in videos and text.

## Incorporating what I learned as a Software Developer

I’m a Software Developer gradually transitioning into DevOps and SRE. Currently, I work as a Full Stack Developer using Fedora Linux as my operating system, which serves as the environment where I run my development tools like VS Code. While Linux is the base, it’s not the main focus of my daily work. However, I found many ways to integrate it into my daily basis: it even increased my productivity by incorporating more the command line in the following ways:

- Creating a system monitor (currently in progress) that alerts me when CPU usage is high.  
- Using `find` and `grep` to locate files and specific content efficiently.
- Creation of directories and files for new projects.
- Improving navigation and productivity by using command-line tools (`cd, ls, tree` , etc.).

## Conclusion

I would recommend this course to everyone who is interested or is already using Linux, as it is very helpful to learn it deeply, as well as to improve productivity by the usage of bash commands. 

 I have never taken a course that is so well explained and of such high quality — and it’s free!It even motivated me to complete another Linux Foundation course I enrolled in: [DevOps and SRE Fundamentals: Implementing Continuous Delivery (LFS261)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/devops-and-sre-fundamentals-implementing-continuous-delivery-lfs261/){:target="_blank"}
. But that’s a story for another post, as it’s another gem.

If you're interested, you can take the course at: [https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/){:target="_blank"}. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Good luck in your learning journey!
