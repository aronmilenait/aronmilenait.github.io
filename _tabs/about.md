I’m Milena Sol Aron, a Software Developer based in Argentina, currently transitioning into DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). I have over two years of experience in the field, as I started working as a Software Developer in 2023.

My interest in IT began in 2015 when I started using Linux at the age of 13. Since then, I haven't stopped using it, and my love for this powerful operating system has only grown. I currently use the Fedora distribution.

I’m pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of the People, which allows me to continue working full time as a Software Developer while studying DevOps and SRE at my own pace.
